/* Initial source code for lesson 10 exercises
 *
 * Instructions
 * ------------
 *
 * Solve each exercise in a separate function
 * name each function as exerciseN (replace N with exercise number)
 * call the function of each exercise in function main (one a a time)
 *
 * Keep all functions exerciseN (don't erase the code of previous
 * just keep different names: exercises01   exercise 02 ....)
 * see example already in this file
 *
 *        Note: functions in C will be addressed soon
 *              for now, just use this scheme to simplify the lesson
 *
 * At the end, submit changes to github
 * some exercises are for practice, some are for project
 * all should be submitted, however:
 * -           ->> reserve time for the project <<--
 *

/* use this "template" for your functions */
/* change 0 to the number of the exercise */
/* keep all functions you wrote */
void exercise0() {
	/* do something */
}

int main() {
	/* just call your current exercise function (just one at a time) */
	/* change 0 to the number of the current exercise function */
	exercise0();
	return 0;
